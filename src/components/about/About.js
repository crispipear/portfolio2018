                <h1>My story</h1>
                <p>
                  I actually wanted to be a visual designer entering college. 
                  As I learned more in the topics relative to design, I was intrigued by the idea of designing 
                  solutions for problems and technology. It inspired me to explore the human-centered design and engineering aspects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I find myself enjoy coding more and building out my own designs.
                  I also like to experiment with data-driven projects and break some stuff in the back end. 
                  When I am not breaking stuff I like to play games and eat good food :^)
