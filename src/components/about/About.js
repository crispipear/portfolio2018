                <h1>My story</h1>
                <p>
                  I started out as a visual designer in the beginning of college. As I learned more in the topics relative to design, I was intrigued by the idea of designing 
                  solutions for problems with technology, which inspired me to explore the human-centered design and engineering aspect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years I find myself enjoy coding more and being able to build out my own designs. I also like to experiment with data-driven projects and break some stuff in the back end. 
                  When I am not breaking stuff I like to play games and eat good food :^)
